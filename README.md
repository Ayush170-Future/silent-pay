## About
Silent payments in Bitcoin is a new way to receive private payments from anyone on a single static address without on-chain linkability of payments or a need for on-chain notifications.

This library is a JavaScript/TypeScript implementation of silent payments. The library exposes core functionalities to send to a silent payment address, receive payments to a silent payment address and spend from a silent payment address.
The library also provides a simple wallet implementation that provides support for silent payments out of the box.

Read more about silent payments in [BIP 352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458) and [Ruben Somsen's post](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8).

## Uses

- **Silent Payments:** The library provides core silent payment functionalities.
- **Wallet Integration:** The library provides a simple wallet implementation that supports silent payments.
- **Custom Wallets:** The library can be used to build custom wallets that support silent payments.
- **Research:** The library can be used to research and experiment with silent payments.
- **Education:** The library can be used to learn about silent payments and how they work.


## Architecture

The project is divided into two modules. The core module provides the core functionalities of silent payments and the wallet module provides a simple wallet that supports silent payments.

```console
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ core
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ wallet
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ db
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ network
â””â”€â”€ test
```
| **Directory**        | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`src/core`**       | Contains core library functions that are needed to support silent payment integration in a wallet.               |
| **`src/wallet`**     | Encompasses the wallet class which is responsible for all wallet-operations.                                     |
| **`src/wallet/db`**  | Exposes a db interface. Provides a file-based key value database.                                                |
| **`src/wallet/db`**  | Exposes an interface for network operations. Provides an Esplora client which implements the network interface.  |
| **`test`**           | Contains unit and integration tests.                                                                             |

## Project Status

The project is currently in a pre-alpha stage, intended for demonstration and prototyping. The wallet may have known/unknown bugs. Basic silent payments functionality works on `regtest` and `testnet` networks, but it's not recommended for `mainnet` use.

If you're interested in contributing to the project, explore the [open issues](https://github.com/Bitshala-Incubator/silent-pay/issues) and submit a PR.

## Contributing

The project is under active development by a few motivated Bitcoin devs. Any contribution for features, tests, docs and other fixes/upgrades is encouraged and welcomed. The maintainers will use the PR thread to provide reviews and suggestions, and are generally proactive at merging good contributions.

Few directions for new contributors:

- The list of [issues](https://github.com/Bitshala-Incubator/silent-pay/issues) is a good place to look for contributable tasks and open problems.

- Issues marked with [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Bitshala-Incubator/silent-pay/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are good places to get started.

- [Tests](./test) are a good place to start gathering a contextual understanding of the codebase.

- Reviewing [open PRs](https://github.com/Bitshala-Incubator/silent-pay/pulls) are a good place to understand the codebase and the contribution process.

- Search for `TODO`s in the codebase to find in-line marked code todos and smaller improvements.

### Developer Community

The dev community lurks in a small corner of Discord [here](https://discord.gg/Rfyp2nRGj7) (say ðŸ‘‹, if you drop there from this readme).

Dev discussions predominantly happen via FOSS best practices, and by using Github as the Community Forum.
